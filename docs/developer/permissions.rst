ZMON is a privilege-separated web application which allows different access levels for each user role. User roles are fetched from LDAP after successful authentication.

Currently there are 4 different roles:
 - ADMIN
 - LEAD
 - USER
 - VIEWER

The table below lists the different roles and corresponding access levels:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Feature, ADMIN, LEAD, USER, VIEWER, UNAUTHENTICATED

    Trial Run,               yes, yes, yes, no, no
    Add Comment,             yes, yes, yes, no, no
    Delete Comment,          yes, yes [#dc]_, yes [#dc]_, no, no
    Schedule Downtime,       yes, yes, yes, no, no
    Delete Downtime,         yes, yes, yes, no, no
    Add Dashboard,           yes, yes, yes, no, no
    Edit Dashboard,          yes, yes [#ed]_, yes [#ed]_, no, no
    Add Alert Definition,    yes, yes [#aad]_, yes [#aad]_, no, no
    Edit Alert Definition,   yes, yes [#eadl]_, yes [#eadu]_, no, no
    Delete Alert Definition, yes, yes [#dadl]_, yes [#dadu]_, no, no

As you may have noticed, roles VIEWER and UNAUTHENTICATED have the same access level. This will change in the future.
An unauthenticated user will only be able to see the dashboards, while users with role VIEWER will be able to see all resources.
